What is?
--------
This programm was written for maintenance engineers of UkSATSE (http://uksatse.ua)
and other engineers who organise their work according to "ПТЕ РТЗ ЦА 2007" document.
All navigational equipment must be periodically tested and serviced according to
regulations written by manufacturer or end user enterprise.
In the end of each year senior maintennance engineer writes a formalised service plan
for a certain list of navigational equipment. According to this year plan in the end of
each month a month service plan must constructed, this plan describes types of maintennance
to be contucted in the next month. Writing this month plan manualy in Microsoft Excell or
Open Office Calc usually takes some time and leads to frequent mistakes.
This software reads year maintennance plan from *.ods file and creates month plan
for desired month automatically which save engineers work time and helps avoid errors
while planning.
